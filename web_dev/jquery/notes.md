Release 0: Make a Plan
how I intend to tackle jQuery and learn as much as I can in two hours.
read twenty min
http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_intro.asp

https://www.codeproject.com/articles/157446/what-is-jquery-and-how-to-start-using-jquery

then twenty minutes looking at making something in 
https://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation

PROJECT  - fulfill in jquery what i suggested in web_servers.md for 9.1.
create js page that alters webpage http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_all.asp

AFTERWORDS:
OK, i did not work with www.w3schools - so worked on simple webpage "example-form.html", the linked that html to "project93.js"

I looked at previous examples I worked on - pairing project in 9.2.  I saw the need to include "document.getElementsByTagName()"

first first example i tried did not work - i changed elements of body, but did not see results (though if i then open elements of body, the attributes changed.)
