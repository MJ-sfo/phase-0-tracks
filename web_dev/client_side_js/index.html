	<h1>9.2 Exercise</h1>
	<h2 id="red">Release 0</h2>
	<p>Find a helpful cheat sheet for using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM (you will likely find it helpful to search for "vanilla JavaScript" to distinguish plain JavaScript from its many libraries). Bookmark it -- you'll need it again! Find a few functions that look interesting, and explore them in the console.</p>

	<h2>Release 1</h2>
	<p>In phase-0-tracks/web_dev, create a directory called client_side_js. Create a simple project that uses JavaScript to manipulate the DOM. This can be as simple as a script that changes the style of an element, or something much more complicated if you feel like delving deeper. (Example: A stretch goal might be figuring out how to create new HTML elements with JavaScript and add them to your page, or how to loop through a collection of nodes of a certain class and apply the same effect to all of them.) You don't have to do anything special to delay the DOM manipulation -- it can run right away.
	</p>

	<h2>Release 2</h2>
	<p>Add an event listener to your client_side_js project that delays the execution of some snippet of code until the user clicks or takes some other action. Keep it simple with a console.log call, or get fancy by dramatically revealing an animated GIF -- it's up to you.</p>
