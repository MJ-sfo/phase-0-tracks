# pseudocode
# create a hash
# loop through the hash
# ask user for name for input
# convert, if necessary, input into correct data type, push into hash
# stop loop, print hash
# ask user for any key the paired value the user wants the value changed
# convert input string for key into symbol for key.
# change new input for that key
# when user marks "none" stop, print updated hash
