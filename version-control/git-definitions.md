# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version Control lets user change his own version, independently of other users.  he can "fork" a new version of code - or work on the code, then later merge with the master


* What is a branch and why would you use one?
a branch is a copy of master code to work on independently.  user can experiment on one section before changing the master - or different users can work on their own branches simultaneously. 


* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
a commit is coping select files (the "added" files) to the master.  a good commit message is a consist statement about what changes are made to master since last commit (last save)


* What is a merge conflict?
when multiple commits (saves) to the same master file leads to problems - they overlap, or contradict each other, or somehow "conflict"
